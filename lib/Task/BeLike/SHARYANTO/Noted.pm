# ABSTRACT: Some modules which I take note of because I can never remember their names

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution is a random list of modules which I need to take a note of
because I can never seem to remember their names, usually because the name is
not representative of what the module does, or the term is unusual, or both. Or
it's just my failing memory.

They are categorized by functionalities/topics.

=pkgroup Modules to prevent multiple instances of script running simultaneously

Similar in functionality to L<Proc::PID::File>.

=pkg Sys::RunAlone


=head1 FAQ

=head2 Why don't you just favorite the module in MetaCPAN?

I reserve that for modules which I like/use and would like to be installed on my
Perl installations.
